## Neural Networks with TensorFlow
### Single layered Neural network
### Callback to stop training when condition is met

## Convolution Neural network
Coding convolutions and pooling layers
The concepts introduced in this video are available as 
Conv2D
 layers and 
MaxPooling2D
 layers in TensorFlow. Youâ€™ll learn how to implement them in code in the next video.

## Image Augmentation 
TF ImageDataGenerator helps in generating variation of the image by augmenting them

## Transfer learing
A technique used to use learing from aleady trained large model.

## Classifiers
Binary classifiers - classifying either one or two classes. E.g. Human or horse
Multiple classifiers - classiying more than two classes. E.g. Rock, paper or scissor
